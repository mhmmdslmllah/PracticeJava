	* Only possible if we non-implement the methods of Abstract class in a Regular
	* Class.
	* We can only get implement the methods in a regular Class.
	* To implement the methods of Abstract class in a regular Class we have to use
	* the Annotation @override.
	* By using over ride annotation we can only use the methods of abstract class
	* otherwise we will get an error.
	* A regular class can inherit other regular class by extends keyword.
	* It also can inherit Abstract class by using extend keyword
	* But we must implement the methods of Abstract class which are not implemented.
	* If the methods are implemented in a regular class it will provide @override annotation
	* @override annotation means that this method is inherited from other abstract class.
	* A regular class can inherit from the Interface by using Implement Keyword
	* Implement keyword can be use to Inherit from the Interfaces.
	* A class can inherit from multiple Interfaces.
